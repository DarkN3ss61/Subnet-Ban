Ban Their Subnet!

As requested by @decado (http://forums.pocketmine.net/threads/subnet-ban.2858/) Here is the Subnet ban plugin

Its quite simple to use
/subban add = add the players subnet to the subnet ban list
/subban remove = removes the players subnet to the subnet ban list
/subban list = displays all the subnets on the subnet ban list
/subban reload = reloads the subnet txt file ban listâ€‹

When the plugin is started for the first time it creates the the SubnetBan directory and inside of that it has the subnetBanned.txt file what works that same was as a ban text file, you just put each IP subnet in on its own line

E.g
192.168
123.245
and so on
